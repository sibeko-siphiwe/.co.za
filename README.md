## ðŸŽ¨ About This Project

Welcome to my **digital playground**â€”a fusion of code, design, and way too many caffeine-powered late nights! This repository houses my portfolio website, where I showcase my favorite projects, experiments, and the occasional "why did I think this was a good idea at 2AM?" moments. Built with **love** and **[Tech Stack]**.

## âœ¨ Features

- **ðŸŒˆ Interactive Magic:** Hover animations, smooth transitions, etc (because drama is fun).
- **ðŸ“‚ Project Showcase:** My greatest hits (and hilarious misses) displayed like a tech art gallery.
- **ðŸ”§ Built to Tinker:** Modular components, clean code, and a `/weird-experiments` branch Iâ€™m too scared to merge.
- **ðŸ“± Responsive AF:** Looks great on screens, toasters, and that ancient iPhone 4 in your drawer.
